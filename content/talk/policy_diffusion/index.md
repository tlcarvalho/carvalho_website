abstract: This talk is based on the related article, in which I present the result from a novel database about all initiatives discussed within the South American Defense Council (SADC). My objective is to provide a first identification about the mechanisms through which the Council could act to diffuse defense and security policies for its members. Using descriptive statistics, I could find these mechanisms, which turned into hypotheses to be tested in future analyses.

	abstract = {This essay delves into Brazilian IR academic production to analyze whether these research articles converge with methodological debates taking place in the United States and Europe over the last thirty years. A comparative analysis based on evidence obtained from Systematic Literature Review may suggest that Brazil is differentiating from, and lagging behind, the mainstream of IR academic production at this criterion.},

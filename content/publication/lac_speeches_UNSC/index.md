abstract: This article argues that the political orientation of the government in office in a country may affect its positioning regarding the United Nations Peace Operations. In order to demonstrate that, in this study I compare what is said by officials of leftist and rightist Latin American countries about peacekeeping in UNSC, since the 1990s.

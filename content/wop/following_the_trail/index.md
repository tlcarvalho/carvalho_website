abstract: "In this article, we advance in understanding the development of IR scholarships outside the 'mainstream'. We look at the case of the Brazilian IR academy to explore which topics have been approached by this scholarship, its geographical scope, and how they varied over time. We rely on data about 2417 master’s thesis and doctoral dissertations from all IR graduate programs in the country from 1987 to 2018 and use a Structural Topic Model to obtain latent topics available in these documents. More than allowing us to trace a thematic profile of the Brazilian IR scholarship, the analysis provided evidence to say that (1) its expansion, during the 2000s, led to a higher diversity of topics approached by researchers, which (2) are often related to the international context, domestic factors, and funding issues. At the same time, (3) Brazilian researchers have been extending the geographical scope of their analysis beyond their region in a move that reduces the 'parochialism' that is often attributed to non-Western scholarships."

I am a Ph.D. student in Political Science at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais - UFMG), and a Visiting Graduate Student at the University of California - San Diego (Political Science Department). I am  a member of the International institutions, Foreign Policy and Political Regime Research Network (Rede de Pesquisa em Instituições Internacionais, Política Externa e Regime Político - RIPPERP). I also got my Master's Degree in Political Science from UFMG, and my bachelor's degree in International Relations from the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais (PUC-Minas). 

My research focuses on international security and defense in Latin America, building a Neoclassical Realist framework to understand International Security Policies implemented by Latin American countries in the last 40 years. I have research experience on the following topics: International Security; Foreign Policy; Latin America; Quantitative Methods applied to International Relations; Scientometrics; and Policy Diffusion.

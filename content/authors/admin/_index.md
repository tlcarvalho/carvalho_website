Hello!  

I am an Assistant Professor of Methods in the Department of International Relations at the Rio de Janeiro State University (*Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, UERJ*). Previously, I was a postdoc at the University of São Paulo (USP). I earned my PhD (2022) and my Master's (2018) in Political Science from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), with a research stay at the University of California - San Diego (2021-2022).

My research focuses on international security governance in Latin America. I also conduct research on foreign policy evaluation, as well as Global IR. My work has been published in Latin American Politics and Society, Global Studies Quarterly, Bulletin of Latin American Research, the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of International Studies, Revista Brasileira de Política Internacional, Contexto Internacional, and Brazilian Political Science Review.

I have research experience on the following topics: Methods; International Security; Foreign Policy; Latin America; and Global IR.

I am currently affiliated to the International Relations Research Center (NUPRI-USP) and the International institutions, Foreign Policy and Political Regime Research Network (RIPPERP-UFMG).

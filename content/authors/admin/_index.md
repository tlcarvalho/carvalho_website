I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais - UFMG - Brazil), and was a Visiting Graduate Student at the University of California - San Diego (2021-2022). I am a member of the International institutions, Foreign Policy and Political Regime Research Network (Rede de Pesquisa em Instituições Internacionais, Política Externa e Regime Político - RIPPERP). I also got my Master's Degree in Political Science from UFMG, and my bachelor's degree in International Relations from the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais (PUC-Minas).  

During the 2022-2023 academic year, I am part of the organizing team of the [Graduate Students in International Security, Etc. Workshop](https://wp.nyu.edu/gsise/) (GSISE).  

My research focuses on international security and defense in Latin America, building a new theoretical framework to understand International Security Policies implemented by Latin American countries. I also conduct a secondary agenda on the role of the Latin American IR scholarship amidst Global IR debates. I have research experience on the following topics: International Security; Foreign Policy; Defense Policy; Latin America; Methods; and Global IR.
